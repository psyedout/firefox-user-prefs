# firefox-user-prefs

Tested on Windows laptop and desktop environment, not on mobile ones. Use at your own discretion.

``` 
Do not manually edit prefs.js file.

If you make changes to prefs.js file while the application is running,
the changes will be overwritten when the application exits.

To change a preference value, you can either:
  - modify it via the UI (e.g. via about:config in the browser); or
  - set it within a user.js file in your profile.


This set of prefs are extra hardened with a reduced preference for:

  - Hardware acceleration of website components 
  - Video and graphics rendering 

It completely disallows session cookies, autoplay and other audio-video 
related queries from webservers.  

It de-clutters the browser's homepage and settings page, and gets rid of 
Firefox bloatware like "pocket", search suggestions, and discovery stream.

However, it does allow safe-browsing and web compatibility shims.

This browser profile's main purpose is for viewing plain-text webpages,
while reducing likelihood of browser and device fingerprinting methods
being implemented against it. 

Use a different browser profile for regular browsing with session storage.
```

Now, imagine, just imagine, the following scenario:

You visit a particular website, and its CSS design and content aren't compatibly rendered, as per your browser version. So then, naturally, the java-script extension in your browser, injects a shim, to seamlessly make the content more readable. What else does it inject? Nothing else, just reshapes the content via CSS, and makes certain aspects of the site's webpages, visually more salient, to you. 

What kind of information might you be able to glean, from that reorganized content, which wouldn't otherwise happen for all online user-agents? 

Here, try this as an example, stare at the two O at the top the following ASCII text paragraph, with cross eyes, till you see three O, instead of four, by moving your head further or closer to the glyphs, and then gaze deeply into the text. 

<div align="center">

<p>What manner of magic is this?!
</div>

Yes, it is an [autosterogram,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autostereogram#Mechanisms_for_viewing) like those in "magic-eye" books from the 1990s. You can take your head closer to the screen till your nose touches the screen. Then while preventing your eyes from re-focusing on your natural focal distance, move your head away from the screen. This also works in printed media, in paper and mural format. 

This is only one of the ways in which, I am sometimes forewarned about which public agents from certain public agencies, are currently doing, or are about to do, wrongful things, especially against me. However, I still do not know who in those very same agencies, bothers to send me messages using all manner of [black magic fuckery](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmagicfuckery/), typically known only to them, and why. I mean, I was never even directly affiliated to, or employed by any of them. I merely used to teach remedial classes in mathematics, for a number of poor and wounded American and Canadian citizens returning from active duty, a long-long-time go. So the favors provided to me, by some of the members of those agencies, are most generous. Though simultaneously, the treacheries and harms systematically inflicted by other members of those same groups of agencies, are most heinous. 

See, I do not have Extra Sensory Perceptions, nor do I have any kind of special powers or super-natural abilities. Indeed, even the roaming hermetics knew about these types of tricks, but I'm not that old. And no, I'm not Poseidon, nor am I from project Gemini. 

So, need I give you more of a hint, about who I am, and about [what I do best?](https://github.com/callthis/status-quo/blob/main/docs/0E.md#time-to-rip-apart-and-shred-the-colonialists-cookbook) 

I'm an amateur human, I am best at being an amateur, an amateur at being human. Come on, seriously, have you ever met a professional, whose sole professional job, was to be, a human? 

Professional humans do exist, but they are robots. 

Robots working in various fields of profession in place of a human worker, have been in existence for quite a few decades. But almost none of them have reached a commercially stable stage yet, to replace human beings employed for doing unsupervised industrial tasks and chores, in an open environment. 

At least, you, the readers, can be reassured for now, that your ability to have seen a hidden message in the given chunk of ASCII text, isn't something that robotic systems can accomplish, just yet, most probably not even Google Gemini. There are many ways to encrypt and decipher messages, that specifically require the use of human sensory organs, and practically zero cryptography. But, all of them do require basic mathematics, particularly of algebraic geometry, and of geometric algebra, to accomplish communication of messages, neatly and properly.
